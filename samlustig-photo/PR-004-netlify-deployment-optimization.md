# PR #004: Optimize for Netlify Deployment

## Description
Adds Netlify-specific configuration and deployment scripts to ensure smooth deployment and optimal performance.

## Changes Made

### New Files:
- `scripts/upload-images.sh` - Image directory setup script
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive deployment checklist

### Files Modified:
- `netlify.toml` - Enhanced Netlify configuration
- `package.json` - Added deployment scripts

### Netlify Configuration:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--production=false"

# Security headers
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"

# Image caching
[[headers]]
  for = "/images/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

### New Scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:netlify": "./scripts/deploy-netlify.sh",
    "build:static": "STATIC_EXPORT=true next build"
  }
}
```

### Image Upload Script:
- Creates proper directory structure for images
- Sets up placeholder images
- Provides clear instructions for image management

### Key Features:
1. **Optimized Build**: Proper Node.js version and build flags
2. **Security Headers**: Essential security headers for production
3. **Image Caching**: Long-term caching for static images
4. **Deployment Scripts**: One-command deployment
5. **Directory Structure**: Organized image storage

### Benefits:
- **Performance**: Optimized caching and build process
- **Security**: Production-ready security headers
- **Developer Experience**: Easy deployment process
- **Image Management**: Clear structure for photo storage

## Testing
- [x] Netlify build configuration validated
- [x] Deployment scripts work correctly
- [x] Image directory structure created
- [x] Security headers properly configured
- [x] Caching headers optimized

## Deployment Instructions
1. Connect repository to Netlify
2. Run `npm run deploy:netlify` for manual deployment
3. Or push to main branch for automatic deployment
4. Upload images to `public/images/` directory structure
